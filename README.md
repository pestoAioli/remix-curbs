# Curbs!


## About this app

Curbs is an application for finding and adding "skate spots" to a map, i.e public spaces that (hopefully) anyone can skate in.

## Development

I created this app using Remix, a full-stack, SSR framework for React, and plain css for styling(with some help from Reach UI).For my database I used Postgres with Prisma as my ORM of choice. For the mapping functionality I used the Leaflet API.
