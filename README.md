# Curbs!
A fullstack React application made by Ricardo Miguel Rivera-Chavez

## About this app

Curbs is a fully responsive web application for finding and adding "skate spots" near you to a map. The idea and inspiration behind curbs came to me at a very young age, when I first started skateboarding. I always wished there was a website/app where I could look up street spots to skate in, but the few sites dedicated to this were sparsely used and not very user-friendly, so when I was deciding what I wanted to make for my first real full project, this seemed like the perfect way to kill two birds with one stone :-)

Curbs is fully deployed on fly.io and you can check out (or use) the app here: https://autumn-river-9476.fly.dev/

## Development

I created this app using Remix, a full-stack, SSR framework for React, and plain css for styling(with some help from Reach UI).I used Postgres as my database with Prisma as my ORM of choice. For the mapping functionality I used the Leaflet API. 

## Here are some screenshots of the app:
